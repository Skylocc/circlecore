Contributing
============

If you'd like to donate some time to improving circleguard, pull requests are more than welcome.

We try to keep track of issues through the `circlecore github <https://github.com/circleguard/circlecore/issues>`_,
but aren't always the most rigorous about it. The best way to find out what you can help with is to ask on
`our discord <https://discord.gg/VNnkTjm>`_. We don't bite, I promise :)
