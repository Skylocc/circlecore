        Notes
        -----
        max_angle and max_distance being passed goes a bit against the style
        here of not passing anything more than a replay/beatmap to the
        investigation functions (see: ur()), but if we don't we would iterate
        twice over this massive list of angles between every two data points.
        May be premature optimization but it just doesn't make sense to return
        a huge list and filter it in investigate().

        Returns [[float, float, float], ...] of hits where the angle was less
        than max_angle and the distance between the data points was more than
        min_distance. First float is time the hit occured, second float is angle
        between the data points in degrees, third is distance between the two
        datapoins.
