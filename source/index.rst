Circlecore
==========

A library for analyzing replays and detecting cheated or suspicious replays.

Designed for use in `Circleguard <https://github.com/circleguard/circleguard>`_,
circlecore is easily integratable into any existing python project and we
have worked hard to ensure it is easy to use.

We highly encourage projects that use circlecore - if you are using it in one
of your apps, please let us know and we will link to you somwhere in
our documentation.
