Foreword
========

The following pages serve as an introduction to circlecore. Although they would ideally be exhaustive, they are likely not.
The source code is rather well documented, and you should refer to it whenever possible. You can also browse all classes, methods,
etc by visiting the :doc:`../appendix`.

You are also welcome to ask questions on our `discord <https://discord.gg/VNnkTjm>`_.

To aid in readability, ``import`` statements have been ommitted from all example code blocks. Please supply your own.
